The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM4SD32C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4S-XPRO' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  =  96 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA     =  96 MHz

 - 1 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if Button (sw0) is pressed all LEDs are lit.
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART1 (Virtual Com Port)
   UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM4S RAM:             configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  SAM4S Flash:           configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
